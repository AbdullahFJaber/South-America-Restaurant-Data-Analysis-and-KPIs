# South-America-Restaurant-Data-Analysis-and-KPIs
Comprehensive Excel-based dashboard analyzing KPIs and sales performance of a South American restaurant chain. Includes sales trends (2021‚Äì2022), country-level distribution, customer satisfaction, and profit metrics. Designed Data Analysis and business intelligence insights, performance tracking, and strategic decision-making.

## üìå Overview

This project showcases a business intelligence case study built entirely in Microsoft Excel, focusing on KPIs and sales performance for a rebranded international restaurant chain in South America.

The original dataset was adapted from open-source resources for educational and training purposes. A new fictional brand was created under the name ‚ÄúLa Verde Vida‚Äù, symbolizing healthy, organic, and joyful food experiences. A playful logo design accompanies the brand to reflect its fresh and health-focused concept.

The analysis works directly with curated summary tables (final results only, without raw transaction-level data). The charts and dashboards are static, non-interactive visualizations, created to highlight:

Sales trends (2021‚Äì2022)

Country-level performance distribution

Profit margins and KPI tracking

Customer satisfaction metrics

This project demonstrates how even with limited summarized data, Excel can be leveraged to deliver meaningful insights, clear visual storytelling, and professional KPI dashboards.
