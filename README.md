# South-America-Restaurant-Data-Analysis-and-KPIs
Comprehensive Excel-based dashboard analyzing KPIs and sales performance of a South American restaurant chain. Includes sales trends (2021‚Äì2022), country-level distribution, customer satisfaction, and profit metrics. Designed Data Analysis and business intelligence insights, performance tracking, and strategic decision-making.

## üìå Overview

This project showcases a business intelligence case study built entirely in Microsoft Excel, focusing on KPIs and sales performance for a rebranded international restaurant chain in South America.

The original dataset was adapted from open-source resources for educational and training purposes. A new fictional brand was created under the name ‚ÄúLa Verde Vida‚Äù, symbolizing healthy, organic, and joyful food experiences. A playful logo design accompanies the brand to reflect its fresh and health-focused concept.

The analysis works directly with curated summary tables (final results only, without raw transaction-level data). The charts and dashboards are static, non-interactive visualizations, created to highlight:

Sales trends (2021‚Äì2022)

Country-level performance distribution

Profit margins and KPI tracking

Customer satisfaction metrics

This project demonstrates how even with limited summarized data, Excel can be leveraged to deliver meaningful insights, clear visual storytelling, and professional KPI dashboards.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to analyze restaurant performance data from multiple South American countries to uncover insights related to sales, profitability, and customer satisfaction.
This analysis aims to identify operational gaps, seasonal sales variations, and service quality challenges, providing clear data-driven recommendations to improve both customer experience and overall profitability.


## üîë Key Insights

### 1. KPI Performance Gaps
There are noticeable percentage gaps between sales, profit, and order completion:

- Sales Gap: 15%

- Profit Gap: 11%

- Order Completion Gap: 13%

These variations occur because profit does not increase linearly with sales ‚Äî higher sales volumes may come with higher costs, promotions, or operational inefficiencies. Similarly, incomplete customer orders might indicate supply chain delays or insufficient workforce efficiency, leading to indirect effects on sales and profitability.

### 2. Customer Satisfaction Overview
Customer feedback reveals major weaknesses in speed and service quality, both performing around half of the expected benchmark:

- Speed (54%):
Operations are slow, likely due to inefficient layout design, poor workflow between cashier and kitchen, or limited preparation stations and resources.
Suggested Improvements:

1- Redesign the workspace for better accessibility.

2- Introduce digital order tracking between cashier and kitchen.

3- Implement time-based KPIs for staff and reward faster service.

- Service (53%):
Customer-facing employees require significant training in hospitality and communication skills.
Suggested Improvements:

1- Conduct regular service training and role-playing sessions.

2- Introduce a feedback system for real-time customer input.

3- Establish an incentive plan for excellent service behavior.

- Availability (95%), Quality (86%), and Hygiene (93%) all performed well, showing strong inventory and quality management practices. These areas should continue to be monitored to maintain excellence.

### 3. Sales & Profitability Trends
Monthly performance across 2021 and 2022 shows stable yet fluctuating trends.
Overall, 2022 outperformed 2021, with the only decline observed in May 2022, suggesting a potential seasonal or supply disruption.

- Insights:

Continuous month-to-month performance stability reflects healthy operations.

Investigating the drop in May could uncover a pattern of supply shortage or staff unavailability.

### 4. Regional Sales Distribution

- Argentina achieved the highest sales, contributing over 25% of total revenue.

- Chile recorded the lowest share at 7%.

Possible Reasons:

1- Argentina likely benefits from stronger purchasing power, brand recognition, or store density.

2- Chile‚Äôs lower sales may be due to limited branches, weaker marketing reach, or pricing mismatches.

### Recommendations for Improvement:

1- Expand marketing and digital campaigns in lower-performing regions.

2- Adjust pricing to local market expectations.

3- Introduce loyalty programs and promotions tailored to regional preferences.
